## go.airbat

go.airbat provides functions to convert a airbrake.io short-url using the service at airb.at.

You probably don't need to ever use this package, it was only created to seperate short-url calculation from the go.airbrake package.

If you DO need this package, doc is located at godoc.org/github.com/GeertJohan/go.airbat (as always).
